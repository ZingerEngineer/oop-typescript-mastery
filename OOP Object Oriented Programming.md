# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

[What is OOP? & What is an Object?]

- From the title it explains itself, The whole program or programming style is built around objects.

- But what is an object ?

- An object is an entity or a thing that was created from a blueprint and may or not have properties and methods.

- Examples:  
    -- A human: The creation of Allah, it may be male or female and have tons of properties and functionalities (Methods) that can do or execute.

    -- A vehicle: It's the general ideal of "mean of transportation" that could be by air, by sea, by land, etc...

- So in order to have objects, you must have the blueprint that the object got instantiated from right ?
    -- Yes, an object can't exist without that blueprint describing what is that object properties and methods.
    -- That blueprint is something called a **class**.

[Classes]

- What is a Class ?

  - A class is an abbreviated word from "Classification" which means a Group of entities that are when connected with each other they form a description / blueprint of an entity.

  - You can group multiple things with each other even though they don't connect with each other. That won't make that a class, that would be just a group which is a collection.

  - But if you take the human example:

    -- You have a gender, skin color, religion, iris color, hair color, hair style, etc... Even though they seem not so familiar with each other on the individual level, but when they are grouped they describe a human!

    -- More specificaly a blueprint of a human!!

  - Lets try to group the following:

    -- Interest rate, favourite book, favourite car brand. -> that is not a class, grouping these won't make an entity or a meaning or a **blueprint** for something.
